# MLB Starting Pitcher Stats
A script written for a client that takes team level game data and player level data to generate statistics for starting pitchers. Most ofthe clients desired statistics 
were based around a starting pitcher's last two starts. For instance strike outs per batters faced over the last two outings, or pitches thown compared to days off 
between the last two outings. 


The only non-base packages used in this script are the [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) and [`stringi`](https://github.com/gagolews/stringi) 
packages.
